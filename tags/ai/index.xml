when i have any question, i just ask grok/copilot/gemini/chatgpt/deepseek/kimi/qwen, each chat conversation can act a note. it also records your thinking process, from one question to another question &amp;mdash; the chain of thought!
you ask question and LLM take the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can also throw in other context, weblink, pdf, image, all the thing, just as you do in obsidian(s).
but in obsidian, they just stay there and you need to refer and process the information.
but for llms, all the attachment can be loaded into context and llms will process them for you
and transform them into text information for better search and store and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
