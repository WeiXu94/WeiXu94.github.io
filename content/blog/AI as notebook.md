when I use a AI chat tool alot, i can think it as my second knowledge base beside traditional note-taking software (for example, i use obsidian).
when i have any question, i just ask grok/copilot/gemini/chatgpt/deepseek/kimi/qwen, each chat conversation can act a note.
you ask question and LLM take the note.

you can also throw in other context, weblink, pdf, image, all the thing, just as you do in obsidian(s).
but in obsidian, they just stay there and you need to refer and process the information.
but for llms, all the attachment can be loaded into context and llms will process them for you
and transform them into text information for better search and store and understanding.

so i use ai for study and research.
